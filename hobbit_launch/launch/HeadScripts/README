How to setup heads so they are auto booted with the rest of the things

Ok , so in order to make the heads work one must change the current bashrc madness and use a better way to boot them up 
 
/opt/ros/hobbit_hydro/src/hobbit_launch/launch/HeadScripts/updateHead.sh


I literally cannot make it easier than this :)

nc6 192.168.2.199 8080 # Startup Head
nc6 192.168.2.199 8082
nc6 192.168.2.199 8084 # Refresh Head Startup Scripts
nc6 192.168.2.199 8086 # Shutdown Head
nc6 192.168.2.199 8090 # Check if head is alive
